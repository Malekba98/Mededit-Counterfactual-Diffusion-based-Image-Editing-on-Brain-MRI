# Mededit: Counterfactual Diffusion-based Image Editing on Brain MRI
> **Abstract:** *Denoising diffusion probabilistic models enable high-fidelity image synthesis and editing. In biomedicine, these models facilitate coun- terfactual image editing, producing pairs of images where one is edited to simulate hypothetical conditions. For example, they can model the progression of specific diseases, such as stroke lesions. However, current image editing techniques often fail to generate realistic biomedical coun- terfactuals, either by inadequately modeling indirect pathological effects like brain atrophy or by excessively altering the scan, which disrupts cor- respondence to the original images. Here, we propose MedEdit, a condi- tional diffusion model for medical image editing. MedEdit induces pathol- ogy in specific areas while balancing the modeling of disease effects and preserving the original scanâ€™s integrity. We evaluated MedEdit on the At- las v2.0 stroke dataset using Frechet Inception Distance and Dice scores, outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods such as Palette (by 45%) and SDEdit (by 61%). Additionally, clinical evaluations by a board-certified neuroradiologist confirmed that MedEdit generated real- istic stroke scans indistinguishable from real ones. We believe this work will enable counterfactual image editing research to further advance the development of realistic and clinically useful imaging tools.*
